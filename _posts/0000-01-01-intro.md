Notes:

So those of you who were here in 2019 may see this and think, "Hey wait, didn't I see this talk already?" And the answer is yes, 4 years ago I gave this same talk in Cleveland, but that same year, I *also* proposed adding a new time zone module, `zoneinfo` into the standard library, and, within a year I had made myself a victim of my own success, as I had at least partially obsoleted my own talk; so, this year I felt it was time to update my time zone talk and give you all a sense of what the post-`zoneinfo` time zone landscape looks like these days.

So we've got a lot to cover and only 30 minutes to cover it in, so let's jump right in with the basics of time zones!
