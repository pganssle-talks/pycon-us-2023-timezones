# Introduction

## UTC

- Reference time zone
- Monotonic-ish (what's a few leap seconds between friends?)

## Time zones vs. Offsets <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<ul class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
    <li><tt>UTC-6</tt> is an offset</li>
    <li><tt>America/Chicago</tt> is a time zone</tt></li>
    <li><tt>CST</tt> is a highly context-dependent abbreviation:

Notes:

We can start out easy, with UTC. UTC is the reference time zone, it's the 0 against which offsets are measured. It is mostly monotonic â€” which is to say that it doesn't have daylight saving time. It still has leap seconds, which is infuriating, since leap seconds don't belong in civil time *at all*, much less in the reference time zone, but there has recently been talk of ending the practice of leap seconds, so hopefully, going forward, UTC will actually record 1 second per second of elapsed time.

Another concept that is important to know is the difference between time zones and offsets.

UTC-6 is an offset. It means that you should add 6 hours to the local time to get a time in UTC.

`America/Chicago` is a time zone - it's the set of rules for what offsets and abbreviations apply in a given region as a function of time. In this case, Chicago is the largest city in the region that observes these rules, which is why the zone is called that.

`CST` is a highly context-dependent abbreviation referring to an offset. In Chicago, it means Central Standard Time, which is UTC-6, but if you're in Cuba, it means UTC-5, and if you're in China, it means UTC+8.

Word of advice: never rely on these 3-letter abbreviations. Don't try to parse them into a specific time zone if you can avoid it, don't rely on them meaning a specific thing, and don't even rely on every zone having an associated 3-letter abbreviation.
